# ðŸš‘ AmbulanceSystem


A functional **Ambulance Assistance System** that combines **patient pulse monitoring** with **RFID-based traffic signal control** to ensure faster emergency response. The system updates real-time pulse data to a server, turns traffic lights green when an ambulance approaches, and triggers a buzzer alert upon hospital arrival.



## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Real-time Patient Pulse Monitoring** â€“ Sends data to a central server for hospital preparation.
- **RFID-Based Traffic Signal Control** â€“ Automatically turns green when ambulance is detected near the signal.
- **Hospital Proximity Alert** â€“ Activates buzzer as the ambulance nears the hospital.
- **Traffic Delay Reduction** â€“ Ensures quicker and safer ambulance transit.
